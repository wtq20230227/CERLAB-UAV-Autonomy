## II. Installation Guide
This repo has been tested on ROS Melodic with Ubuntu 18.04 and ROS Noetic with Ubuntu 20.04 and it depends on the ROS packages: [octomap](https://wiki.ros.org/octomap), [mavros](https://wiki.ros.org/mavros), and [vision_msgs](https://wiki.ros.org/vision_msgs). Installing the package with the following commands:

```
# step1: install dependencies
sudo apt install ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-octomap* && sudo apt install ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-mavros* && sudo apt install ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-vision-msgs

# step 2: clone this repo to your workspace
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Zhefan-Xu/CERLAB-UAV-Autonomy.git

# optional: switch to simulation branch for autonomous_flight
# the default branch is for real flight and PX4 simulation
cd path/to/autonomous_flight
git checkout simulation

# step 3: follow the standard catkin_make procedure
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make
```
setup environment variable. Add following to your ```~/.bashrc```
```
source path/to/uav_simulator/gazeboSetup.bash
```
## III. Run Autonomy DEMO
This section shows the most typical ones: **navigation**, **exploration**, and **inspection**. Note that the default environment and the flight parameters might be different from the demos shown as below. Please check [uav_simulator](https://github.com/Zhefan-Xu/uav_simulator) for changing the simulation environments and [autonomous_flight](https://github.com/Zhefan-Xu/autonomous_flight) for adjusting flight parameters.

Before getting started, please make sure you are in the ```simulation``` branch of the submodule [autonomous_flight](https://github.com/Zhefan-Xu/autonomous_flight) for the following demos (please check the link for detailed explanations):
```
cd path/to/autonomous_flight
git branch

# if the output says you are not in the simulation branch, please run the following (otherwise please ignore): 
git checkout simulation
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make clean # if you switch the branch for autonomous_flight
catkin_make
```

### a. **Autonomous Navigation:**  Navigating to a given goal position and avoiding collisions.    

```
# start simulator
roslaunch uav_simulator start.launch # recommand to use the corridor env for your first trial

# open the Rviz visualization
roslaunch remote_control dynamic_navigation_rviz.launch # if your test env has dynamic obstacles

# run the navigation program
roslaunch autonomous_flight dynamic_navigation.launch # if your test env has dynamic obstacles

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# (alternatively, if your test env is purely static, you can run the following instead)
# open the Rviz visualization
roslaunch remote_control navigation_rviz.launch # if your test env only has static obstacles

# run the navigation program
roslaunch autonomous_flight navigation.launch # if your test env only has static obstacles
```

Once the robot is hovering at the predefined height (check the terminal output messages), you can use the ```2D Nav Goal``` to click a goal point in ```Rviz``` and you can see example results shown below:

https://github.com/Zhefan-Xu/CERLAB-UAV-Autonomy/assets/55560905/31f4e6eb-857c-43d0-a02c-8defa8eea12c


### b. **Autonomous Exploration: Exploraing an unknown environments and create a map.**

```
# start simulator
roslaunch uav_simulator start.launch # recommand to use the floorplan2 env for your first trial

# open the Rviz visualization
roslaunch remote_control exploration_rviz.launch 

# run the navigation program
roslaunch autonomous_flight dynamic_exploration.launch
```

The example exploration process is shown in the video demo as below:

https://github.com/Zhefan-Xu/CERLAB-UAV-Autonomy/assets/55560905/e0d953de-a542-49c3-86ca-b44d77ff7653


### c. **Autonomous Inspection: Navigating to the target and inspecting it with a zig-zag path.**

```
# start simulator
roslaunch uav_simulator start.launch # # recommand to use the tunnel_dynamic_1 env for your first trial

# open the Rviz visualization
roslaunch remote_control inspection_rviz.launch 

# run the navigation program
roslaunch autonomous_flight dynamic_inspection.launch
```

The example inspection process is shown in the video demo as below:

https://github.com/Zhefan-Xu/CERLAB-UAV-Autonomy/assets/55560905/0e580d08-7003-4732-a5b0-5d4041f7d3fd


## IV. PX4 Simulation & Real Flight 
This section talks about running this framework in the PX4-based simulation or conducting real flight experiments. Please first follow the PX4 simulation installation guide as provided in [uav_simulator](https://github.com/Zhefan-Xu/uav_simulator).

Before getting started, please make sure you are in the ```px4``` branch of the submodule [autonomous_flight](https://github.com/Zhefan-Xu/autonomous_flight) for the following demos (please check the link for detailed explanations):
```
cd path/to/autonomous_flight
git branch

# if the output says you are not in the px4 branch, please run the following (otherwise please ignore): 
git checkout px4
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make clean # if you switch the branch for autonomous_flight
catkin_make
```

### a. PX4 Simulation Experiments
The purpose of having another PX4 simulation (besides the simulator we have shown in the previous section) is to simulate **ALL** behaviors that we might encounter in the real flight. To run the same demos in the previous section, the only change we need to do is to run the following command to start the simulator instead.
```
# start PX4 simulator
roslaunch uav_simulator px4_start.launch
```

### b. Real Flight Experiments
Once you have tested the flight in the PX4 simulation, the real flight experiments will have exactly the same behavior as you saw in the simulation. The inputs required for this framework in the real flight experiments are:
 - ```The robot pose/odometry```: The framework requires a SLAM/VIO system that can estimate the robot states.
 - ```The depth image```: The framework expects the depth image to detect objects and construct the map.

Check all the parameters in the [autonomous_flight](https://github.com/Zhefan-Xu/autonomous_flight)  accordingly before the actual flight!!!

### c. Examples of Real Flight Experiments

## VI. Acknowledgement
The author would like to express his sincere gratitude to Professor Kenji Shimada for his great support and all CERLAB UAV team members who contribute to the development of this research.

## VII. Write at the End
This repository concludes my first two-year Ph.D. work at CMU, and I would like to share it to contribute to the autonomous UAV research community. At the beginning, I truly felt the frustration as an autonomous robot researcher due to the lack of a comprehensive development framework. As a result, I hope my code can provide researchers a comprehensive and easy-to-understand platform and let them focus on algorithm/theory design instead of the software pipeline. In the meanwhile, this research and developed framework are not perfect and can be further improved; <ins>**thus, I am actively looking for collaborators in research and development to improve the UAV/robot autonomy level. Please don't hesitate to reach out for potential collaboration!**<ins>
